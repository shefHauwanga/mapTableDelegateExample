# mapTableDelegateExample
An app I've created to demonstrate the use of delegates to communicate across controllers.

This is just an example I created to show how you could use delegates to communicate across 
controllers without have to use NotificationCenter. It consists of two container controllers, 
ChildMapViewController & ChildTableViewController. Theyâ€™re both within ParentContainerController 
view hierarchy. This is going to be further explained in an upcoming article where I show both 
how to use container views & delegates.
